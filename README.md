# Two-Wheel Balancing Robot (Inverted Pendulum) 

This Project combines an Accelerometer and Gyroscope with an STM32 microcontroller to implement an inverted pendulum in the form of a balancing robot. The robot takes in accelerometer and gyroscope values continuously based on a sampling rate, and feeds the values into a PWD motor class. The motor class deciphers the values and spins the motors accordingly to keep the robot balanced. The accelerometer and gyroscope come with an external MPU that interfaces with the STM32 using I2C protocol to send values appropriately.
